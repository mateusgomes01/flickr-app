Basic Flickr viewing app

Exercise:
=======
Fetch photos from the Flickr API and display the results on the PhotoListViewController

Note: you are encouraged to leverage your favorite apple technologies to accomplish this task (uikit, swiftui, async/await, combine, etc...)

We provide two boilerplate xcodeprojects. 

One for those who prefer to complete the exercise in UIKit and another for those who prefer to leverage SwiftUI.
